## Problem

- Polish ISP (Orange) provides separate PPPoE credentials for IPv4 and IPv6
- Ubiquiti only allows one PPPoE session per physical WAN port
  - therefore, entry-level Unifi Express won't work

# Guide

1. Configure two WANs â€“ one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6, using the PPPoE credentials from Neostrada
2. SSH into the UCG Ultra
3. Create a file: `/etc/rc.d/ipv6-route.sh` with the contents from the one in this repository
4. Make it executable with `chmod +x /etc/rc.d/ipv6-route.sh`
5. Make it run on boot with `ln -s /etc/rc.d/ipv6-route.sh /etc/rc.local`
